# Recommended Books for Linux Systems Programming & OS Internals

(Do <leader>.w for good word wrap)

This is a curated list of books for learning Linux systems programming, operating system concepts, concurrency, and kernel development. The recommendations are structured based on practical focus, conceptual depth, and supplemental resources.

FIRST READ: The Linux Programming Interface] (Michael Kerrisk)** ✅


---

## Core Linux Programming & System Calls

- **[The Linux Programming Interface] (Michael Kerrisk)** ✅
  - Essential for mastering Linux system calls, file descriptors, threads, signals, and IPC.
  - Covers API usage and behavior nuances in depth.
  
- **[Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment]() (Stevens & Rago)** ✅
  - Classic reference on POSIX and UNIX programming fundamentals.
  - Great complement to Kerrisk.

- **[Linux Kernel Development] (Robert Love)**
  - Focuses on kernel internals from a developer perspective.
  - Practical, hands-on approach.

- **[Understanding the Linux Kernel](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Linux-Kernel-Daniel-Bovet/dp/0596005652) (Bovet & Cesati)**
  - Detailed reference on kernel structures and inner workings.
  - Useful as a deeper companion resource.

## Operating Systems Concepts & Internals

- **[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) (Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau)** ✅
  - Free online, excellent conceptual explanations.
  - Recommended for a solid OS foundation.

- **[Modern Operating Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/013359162X) (Tanenbaum & Bos)**
  - Textbook-oriented, covers wide OS topics.
  - Good for conceptual understanding.

- **[OS Concepts](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/1119456339) (Silberschatz, Galvin, & Gagne)**
  - Standard textbook; general OS coverage.
  - Less focused on Linux-specific details.

- **[OS Internals and Design Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Internals-Principles-8th/dp/0133805913) (William Stallings)**
  - Broad principles, minimal Linux focus.

- **[Operating Systems: Principles and Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Principles-Practice-Anderson/dp/0985673524) (Anderson & Dahlin)**
  - Course-style OS learning with case studies.

---

## Concurrency & Synchronization

- **[Little Book of Semaphores](http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/) (Allen B. Downey)** ✅
  - Excellent focused resource on synchronization patterns and concurrency problems.

---

## Practical Linux Programming

- **[Advanced Linux Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Linux-Programming-Mark-Mitchell/dp/0201791296) (Mitchell, Oldham, & Samuel)**
  - Practical guide, somewhat dated but useful.

- **[UNIX Systems Programming](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Systems-Programming-Robert-Kay/dp/013637285X) (Kay & Robbins)**
  - Decent for exercises and system-level programming.

- **[ThinkOS](https://greenteapress.com/wp/thinkos/) (Allen Downey)**
  - Lightweight OS concepts and exercises; educational rather than practical.

## Recommended Reading Path (Roadmap)

1. **Beginner Linux Systems Programmer**
   - **OSTEP** → solid conceptual understanding.
   - **Little Book of Semaphores** → basic concurrency.

2. **Intermediate Linux Programming**
   - **The Linux Programming Interface (Kerrisk)** → core Linux APIs.
   - **Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (Stevens & Rago)** → POSIX and UNIX fundamentals.

3. **Advanced Linux / Kernel Focus**
   - **Linux Kernel Development (Love)** → kernel internals and practical exercises.
   - **Understanding the Linux Kernel (Bovet & Cesati)** → deep reference.

4. **Supplemental / Theory**
   - **Modern Operating Systems (Tanenbaum & Bos)** → OS theory.
   - **OS Concepts (Silberschatz, Galvin, & Gagne)** → OS course standard.
   - **Other OS textbooks (Stallings, Anderson & Dahlin)** → optional for broader perspective.
